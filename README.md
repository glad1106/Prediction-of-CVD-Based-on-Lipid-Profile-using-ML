Research Work
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a global health concern, necessitating continuous efforts to develop predictive models for early risk assessment and intervention. This research employs machine learning techniques to predict CVD based on lipid profiles and extends its focus to estimate the future risk of CVD within the studied population. The study encompasses an array of features, including LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and additional factors like age, BMI, blood glucose, and blood pressure. Utilising logistic regression and deep learning neural network. The research classifies CVD risk into four distinct categories, namely atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, offering valuable insights for tailored prevention and intervention strategies. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to reduce CVD by enhancing predictive accuracy and providing shade risk categorization.
